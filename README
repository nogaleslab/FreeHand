These scripts are used for calculating the free-hand test for single particles in electron microscopy images, implementing protocols developed by Rosenthal &  Henderson, 2003, J. Mol. Biol.  

They were given to the Nogales lab from John Rubinstein at University of Toronto.  

Master scripts:
- 'ctftilt.py' - For leginon micrographs with .box files, estimate defocus and angle with ctftilt.exe and extract particles.
- 'freeHand_wrapper.py' - Using EMAN2/Sparx scripts, assign euler angles and perform free-hand test
- 'freeHand_calc_plot.py' - Generate free-hand plots and consolidate files into an output folder
- 'free_param.par' - necessary input file for 'freeHand_wrapper.py' and 'freeHand_calc_plot.py'
